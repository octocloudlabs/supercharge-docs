### Workshop information

Today you will be using Codespaces in the **octocloudlabs** organization. You should have received an email invite to the organization.  If not, see our facilitator (Scott is sitting in the front row.)

### Why do you need to be in the organization

Codespaces is rolling out to everyone. It will take several days for it to be available to everyone.  To ensure that you can use Codespaces today, GitHub has preallocated codespace instances in the octocloudlabs organization. So, if you in the org, you can do the labs.

This is a workaround is needed for you to complete  today's workshop, in the future Codespaces will just work for everyone.

### Fork the lab repositories

Committing code changes while editing within a codespace is the same as when editing code in a local repository. The changes are stored locally, within the Codespace. Syncing and pushing the changes back to the GitHub hosted repo is the same too. 

Note: Syncing is only allowed to a repo that you own. In the GitHub world, this is accomplished by forking the repository

In the labs you'll work with three repositories that we've created.

Next week, after the conference is over, you can find the repositories at <a href="httpw:/github.com/linkedinlearning/">GitHub.com/LinkedInLearning<a/>

💡 **Instructor tip:**

>Instructors create a repository for the training. The learners use the repository. That way they can see the example files and edit them to match the instruction. Having the students fork the training repo allows them to save changes as they progress through the training.
