## LinkedIn Learning: A Practical Example of Codespaces for Hands-On Learning

A major blocker for learning to code has often been a complex setup process just to get started. In many cases before you can start learning, you have to configure the coding environment, install extensions, download and configure dependencies, and set up tools including previewers and code linters.

LinkedIn Learning has spent the past one year developing new course types and learning modalities to lower these barriers and get learners straight to hands-on practice. In this part of the workshop, we'll look at this methodology in more detail.

Our example is Angie Jones' course "Hands-On Instruction: Java," one of 50+ new courses we are publishing today with GitHub Codespaces support.



## Initial Setup

1. Spin up a new Codespace for the exercise files repo.
2. Follow the instructions set out in the "Project Setup" movie.
  
## Background

Booting up Codespaces for this course, the learner is placed in a pre-configured environment for Java development with all but one extension pre-installed, the project itself is set up and configured, and the learner can jump right in and start coding.

In this first lesson, the instructor helps the learner through the final steps to prepare for hands-on practice including installing a necessary extension (This extension cannot be pre-installed by Codespaces instead, Codespaces is configured to recommend the extension) and starting up the Java project.
